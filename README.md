The theme ‘Everything is Alive’ inspired me to use my creativity and bring paper dolls to life. When I started researching different paper dolls, I came across the Katy Keene paper dolls that were in Archie comic books. I vividly remember reading these comic books and seeing Katy Keene as a character in the books and wanting to cut out the paper dolls so badly, however I rented the books from my library. Although I never got to play with the Katy Keene paper dolls, I grew up playing with different versions of paper dolls and thought it would be fun to bring paper dolls to life for this assignment. To really bring this idea to life, I decided that each scene in my game would use the doll and outfits from different Katy Keene paper doll pages. I customized backgrounds and visuals for each scene to match the clothing and style of each doll, which helped develop the visual aesthetic of the game. The game Katy Kouture provides a feminine perspective on video game design and the theme ‘Everything is Alive’ inspired me to bring Katy Keene paper dolls from Archie comic books to life!
